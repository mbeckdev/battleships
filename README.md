# Battleship

Following a 3 video tutorial to make a muliplayer battleship game

https://mbeckdev.github.io/battleships/ <-- See it live here (in progress)

http://battleship.tech/ <-- Final product should look something like this (I did not make this one)

1st video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U64vIhh0TyM - single player version using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (done!)

2rd video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpAwggQJPUQ - multiplayer setup using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Heroku

3rd custom https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6JTM-zt-dQ - CSS, animations

## Notes

Things to fix

- The computer hits are red, no matter if it's on your ship or on an empty space. They should be different.
- When placing your pieces vertically, they snap to weird spots depending on which square you clicked on the rectangle.
- Squishing the width of the screen messes with the board. Maybe 3rd video will fix this with CSS.
